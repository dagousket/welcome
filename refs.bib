	abstract = {During sea urchin development, secretion of Nodal and BMP2/4 ligands and their antagonists Lefty and Chordin from a ventral organizer region specifies the ventral and dorsal territories. This process relies on a complex interplay between the Nodal and BMP pathways through numerous regulatory circuits. To decipher the interplay between these pathways, we used a combination of treatments with recombinant Nodal and BMP2/4 proteins and a computational modelling approach. We assembled a logical model focusing on cell responses to signalling inputs along the dorsal-ventral axis, which was extended to cover ligand diffusion and enable multicellular simulations. Our model simulations accurately recapitulate gene expression in wild type embryos, accounting for the specification of ventral ectoderm, ciliary band and dorsal ectoderm. Our model simulations further recapitulate various morphant phenotypes, reveals a dominance of the BMP pathway over the Nodal pathway, and stresses the crucial impact of the rate of Smad activation in D/V patterning. These results emphasise the key role of the mutual antagonism between the Nodal and BMP2/4 pathways in driving early dorsal-ventral patterning of the sea urchin embryo.},

	abstract = {Precise patterns of gene expression are driven by interactions between transcription factors, regulatory DNA sequences, and chromatin. How DNA mutations affecting any one of these regulatory "layers" are buffered or propagated to gene expression remains unclear. To address this, we quantified allele-specific changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression in F1 embryos generated from eight Drosophila crosses at three embryonic stages, yielding a comprehensive data set of 240 samples spanning multiple regulatory layers. Genetic variation (allelic imbalance) impacts gene expression more frequently than chromatin features, with metabolic and environmental response genes being most often affected. Allelic imbalance in cis-regulatory elements (enhancers) is common and highly heritable, yet its functional impact does not generally propagate to gene expression. When it does, genetic variation impacts RNA levels through two alternative mechanisms involving either H3K4me3 or chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac. Changes in RNA are more predictive of variation in H3K4me3 than vice versa, suggesting a role for H3K4me3 downstream from transcription. The impact of a substantial proportion of genetic variation is consistent across embryonic stages, with 50\% of allelic imbalanced features at one stage being also imbalanced at subsequent developmental stages. Crucially, buffering, as well as the magnitude and evolutionary impact of genetic variants, is influenced by regulatory complexity (i.e., number of enhancers regulating a gene), with transcription factors being most robust to cis-acting, but most influenced by trans-acting, variation.},

	abstract = {Wound response programs are often activated during neoplastic growth in tumors. In both wound repair and tumor growth, cells respond to acute stress and balance the activation of multiple programs, including apoptosis, proliferation, and cell migration. Central to those responses are the activation of the JNK/MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Yet, to what extent these signaling cascades interact at the
              cis
              -regulatory level and how they orchestrate different regulatory and phenotypic responses is still unclear. Here, we aim to characterize the regulatory states that emerge and cooperate in the wound response, using the
              Drosophila melanogaster
              wing disc as a model system, and compare these with cancer cell states induced by

              in the eye disc. We used single-cell multiome profiling to derive enhancer gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) by integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression signals. We identify a ‘proliferative’ eGRN, active in the majority of wounded cells and controlled by AP-1 and STAT. In a smaller, but distinct population of wound cells, a ‘senescent’ eGRN is activated and driven by C/EBP-like transcription factors (Irbp18, Xrp1, Slow border, and Vrille) and Scalloped. These two eGRN signatures are found to be active in tumor cells at both gene expression and chromatin accessibility levels. Our single-cell multiome and eGRNs resource offers an in-depth characterization of the senescence markers, together with a new perspective on the shared gene regulatory programs acting during wound response and oncogenesis.},

	abstract = {Reducing fishing discards is a major concern for fisheries resource managers. Modifying gear by increasing mesh sizes or inserting selective devices is one of the means used by fishermen to reduce catches of undersized individuals or unwanted species. Experiments are regularly carried out on board commercial vessels to quantify the effectiveness of the devices tested. This involves observing catches by collecting a series of indicators such as the size, number and weight of individuals and species caught. The R package developed as part of the INSER project is designed to apply several treatments and statistical tests to these indicators in order to produce a summary report of the performance of the devices tested onboard of trawlers. This report presents the approach and functions of the ‘inser’ tool, which is intended for the entire community of fisheries scientists who want a rapid and systematic analysis of selectivity data. The final output allows to assess the effectiveness fishing gear modification which can be rapidly reported to managers and professional fishermen.},
