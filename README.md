## Hello ✌️

I'm Swann, I'm a bioinformatician and data scientist.

I have a PhD in bioinformatics and I am passionate about data analysis and life sciences in general. Among that, I have a soft spot for R programming and marine biology.

You can find here some of my projects, mostly in R, but also in Python and bash.

Cheers !
